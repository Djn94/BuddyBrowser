10 questions- through html ? 

htmlRoutes file: a GET route to /survey, displaying the survey page (it's own html)
default switch case to home.html, displaying home page.

apiRoutes
a get route to api/friends, displaying a JSON of possible friends (how to return database as json?)

POST routes api/friends that will handle incoming survey results and POST them to the server 
also will handle compatability logic
>Finding the difference between two numbers
I guess if a > b, a = N1, b=n2, else a = n2, b = n1, 
n1 - b1 = difference

results of survey will come in as an array of numbers, will need logic to sort the arrays and remove all duplicates (lil algos ooo), and then a function for to calculate the differences between remaining array items

modal pop up with lowest difference json object
